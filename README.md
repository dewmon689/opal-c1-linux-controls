## Background

The Opal C1 is a high-quality webcam that uses the depthai framework internally. While it works as a standard UVC camera, advanced controls like manual focus require using the depthai API to send control commands to the camera hardware.

This project provides a working solution for Linux users who want professional camera control, especially for disabling the distracting auto focus during video calls.

## Requirements

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu)
- Python 3.8+
- Opal C1 camera connected via USB
- depthai framework
- OpenCV

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Planned features:
- GUI application for real-time control
- Exposure and white balance controls
- Camera presets/profiles
- System tray integration
